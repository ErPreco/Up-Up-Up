# Up Up Up

A simple game where you have to drag on the screen for jumping higher and higer. Check it out on [itch.io](https://aprecoma.itch.io/up-up-up) (if it does not start at the first try refresh the page, and if you get stuck on and floating island pause and unpause the game).

Made with **Unity 2022.3.45f1**, here the "Assets" folder for sharing the logic and components.
- A unique scene where you can navigate the menu and play.
- A **chunk generation** made by myself.
- **Scriptable objects** for creating different types of platforms.
- A pretty blob of code (it was my first decent 2D game ðŸ™ƒ).
